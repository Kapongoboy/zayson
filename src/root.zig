// JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a lightweight, text-based,
// language-independent data interchange format.  It was derived from

// data.

// This document removes inconsistencies with other specifications of
// JSON, repairs specification errors, and offers experience-based
// /interoperability guidance.
